# activityCosts

Demo for Salman

The files here are to be ran on a ARM (M1 or M2) Mac. They will be no temperature sensor nor actuators. The point here is to get or update the activity cost asssociated with each service.

Place each system in its own directory and start them from the command prompt. Make sure it creates its new systemconfig file.

You can update the activity costs using the Postman application (see screenshot) by PUTing to the activity cost form to that system.
